This first set of experiments takes ground station data, and TIE-GCM model outputs for the same dates. 
April 9-11 2024

To start to explore merging datasets, visualizing, and training early models. 

Celestrak data is explored. KP1 - KP8 and AP1 - AP8 are combined into Xarrays. Plotted for testing. 

Gradients looks at not the values of tec but how tec is changing. 
Suncentered explores moving the map such that the animations are from the sun's perspective. 
is the ionosphere a mirror of the sun in some way.. The dark side of the ionosphere has sun side features, dragged into it... pretty cool to see from this perspective. 
Orthographic takes flat plots and shows them as globes. Both sunny side and the "dark" side of the ionosphere. 

What about the moon? during this time frame, where is it.. can it also drag things around?? lets see. 
I did another experiment to plot the orbits..
