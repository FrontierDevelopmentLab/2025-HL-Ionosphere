Note: To use the jpld data from a mounted disk, make sure to delete all index files in jpld/webdataset/ or you will get path errors.

All relevant files for training are in the `scripts/ml` directory. There are old copies of these files in the ioncast package, but they are no longer in use.
They will be used in future when we set up the package for reproducibility.
